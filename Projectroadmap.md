6. Looked up some different code versions of rock paper scissors. Trying to work our way around different ones. DONE
7. I reviewed the sample code to see if there was a way I could make it more concise - DONE
8. Updated the test.py code - DONE
9. We used what we learned from the modules ex: += int() DONE
